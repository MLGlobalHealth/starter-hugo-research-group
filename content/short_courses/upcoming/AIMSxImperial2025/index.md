**Where:** AIMS, Cape Town, South Africa


Imperial College London and AIMS South Africa are pleased to offer a new 1 week short course in Modern Statistics and Global Health. This course is targeted at Masters level students and above with a background in statistics and/or data science, who are interested in modern statistical methods with applications in global population health.

Attendees will learn how to:
+ Write their own models in the probabilistic programming language Stan, carry out full Bayesian inference and assess model convergence,
+ Implement advanced statistical models including mixed effects models for hierarchical data, non-parametric gaussian process regression models and computationally scalable approximations,
+ Implement compartmental models for infectious disease epidemiology,
+ Implement a full phylogenetic analysis pipeline for the analysis of pathogen genomic data,
+ Interpret results and present findings

Attendees will learn on the course through a blended mix of lectures, hands-on computer practicals and guided tutorials, group work and presenting to their peers.

**Pre-requisites:** Good knowledge of Python and git

**Deadline to apply:** 31 January 2025
