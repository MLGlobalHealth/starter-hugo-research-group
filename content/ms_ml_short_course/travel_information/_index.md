# Travel information
## Applying for visas to South Africa
1. Check here whether you will need a visa to enter South Africa: https://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries. If in doubt, please also confirm with your local South African authority.
2. If you need to apply for a visa, contact Gina at AIMS (<gina@aims.ac.za>) for an invitation letter to include in your application. Attach a copy of your passport to the email.
3. Citizens of some countries can apply for e-visas, while others must submit their applications in person at the South African embassy/consulate or a VFS Global office. To check if you are eligible to apply for an e-visa, visit https://ehome.dha.gov.za/epermit/home. Click on 'Create
your profile' to view the list of applicable nationalities."
4. In addition to supporting documents (e.g. proof of sufficient funds, flight itinerary, and
accommodation booking), you will need to complete form DHA-84.


**Important notes:**
+ If you need a visa to enter South Africa, please do not delay in submitting your application,
whether in person or through the e-visa application portal. The visa issuance process can
take a few weeks (or longer), depending on where you apply.
+ Ensure that you submit all required documentation, as South African embassies/consulates may have additional requirements. Please confirm with your local embassy/consulate to determine which documents are needed.
