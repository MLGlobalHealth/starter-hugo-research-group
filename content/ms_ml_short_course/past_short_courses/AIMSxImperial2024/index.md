## Course testimonials and 📸
A few quotes from the course:

_“The course is very important. In this era of AI and Machine learning, it may be the time to train more youngsters and senior researchers to explore more about the use of AI in the field of modelling and treating communicable diseases.”_


_“I have been enjoying the content and learning Modern Statistics and Machine Learning for Global Health, methodology used was really valuable.”_
