<p class="text">Dr Juliette Unwin is a lecturer in statistical science at the University of Bristol.  She is interested in developing and applying novel methods for infectious disease outbreak analysis to help inform policy makers in real time. Her current research focuses on developing spatial temporal renewal-based transmission models alongside estimating the number of children affected by COVID-19 and crises. She has previously been involved in real-time analysis of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo alongside the World Health Organisation and COVID-19 in New York State with the local government.

<p class="text">
Dr Alexandra Blenkinsop is a Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London. Her research centres around developing and applying methods to understand HIV transmission dynamics at a population level to inform policy decisions. She has also worked on projects related to COVID-19, including estimation of children affected by death of parents and caregivers during the pandemic. She has collaborated with the HIV Transmission Elimination Amsterdam Initiative, The Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership and the United States Centers for Disease Control.

<p class="text">
Josh is a third year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London. His research is primarily centered around network point processes, and more generally in the application of networks to aid modelling performance. He is currently working on developing models that incorporate Bayesian nonparametric approaches to help capture latent group structure among the nodes on the network.
