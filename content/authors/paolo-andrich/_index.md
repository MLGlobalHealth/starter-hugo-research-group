Paolo joined the MLGH Network as a postdoctoral researcher in the Fall of 2024. Working under the direction of Prof. Seth Flaxman at the University of Oxford, he focuses on the development of probabilistic epidemiological models with the goal of equipping healthcare providers and decision-makers with tools to better prepare for future emergencies.

Prior to this appointment, Paolo worked for several years as a physics researcher investigating the quantum mechanical properties of nanomaterials, before shifting to a data science career. Most recently, he was part of a team at the World Food Programme supporting the humanitarian crisis preparedness efforts of UN agencies and international NGOs. He is particularly interested in the application of Bayesian statistical approaches and causal reasoning to inform social and public policy.
